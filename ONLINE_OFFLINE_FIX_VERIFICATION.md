# 🔧 Online/Offline Status Fix Verification Guide

## 🎯 **Issues Fixed**

### **1. Frontend Socket Service Issues:**
- ✅ **User ID Storage**: Added `authToken` storage and `getCurrentUserId()` method
- ✅ **Connection Logging**: Enhanced logging to show user ID from token
- ✅ **Token Cleanup**: Clear auth token on disconnect
- ✅ **Stale Closures**: Fixed useEffect dependency array in EnhancedChatPage

### **2. Backend Socket Authentication:**
- ✅ **User Info Storage**: Properly store user info in socket object
- ✅ **Multiple Tab Handling**: Disconnect old socket when user opens new tab
- ✅ **Status Broadcasting**: Properly broadcast online/offline events

## 🧪 **Testing Steps**

### **Step 1: Test Basic Online/Offline Status**

1. **Open Browser Tab 1:**
   - Login as user "wendy_d" (or any user)
   - Check console logs for: `[SOCKET] 🔍 Current user ID from token: [user-id]`
   - Verify user shows as online in chat list

2. **Open Browser Tab 2:**
   - Login as user "bob" (or different user)
   - Check console logs for socket connection
   - Verify both users show as online in each other's chat list

### **Step 2: Test Tab Close Detection**

1. **Close Tab 1:**
   - Close the tab with "wendy_d"
   - Check Tab 2 console for: `[SOCKET] 🔴 User went offline: {userId: 'wendy_d_id', ...}`
   - Verify "wendy_d" shows as offline in "bob's" chat list

2. **Reopen Tab 1:**
   - Reopen the tab and login as "wendy_d"
   - Check Tab 2 console for: `[SOCKET] 🟢 User came online: {userId: 'wendy_d_id', ...}`
   - Verify "wendy_d" shows as online again

### **Step 3: Test Logout Functionality**

1. **Logout from Tab 1:**
   - Click logout button
   - Check console for: `[AUTH] 📡 Offline status sent to server`
   - Check Tab 2 console for offline event

2. **Verify Status Update:**
   - User should show as offline in other tabs
   - Socket should be properly disconnected

### **Step 4: Test Multiple Browser Windows**

1. **Open Same User in Different Browsers:**
   - Chrome: Login as "wendy_d"
   - Firefox: Login as "wendy_d"
   - Check console logs for old socket disconnection

2. **Verify Single Connection:**
   - Only one socket should be active
   - Other tabs should show user as online

## 🔍 **Expected Console Logs**

### **Successful Connection:**
```
[SOCKET] 🔌 Connecting to socket server...
[SOCKET] ✅ Connected successfully with ID: [socket-id]
[SOCKET] 🔍 Current user ID from token: [user-id]
[CONNECTION] 🔗 User [user-id] connected with socket [socket-id]
[ONLINE_STATUS] ✅ User [user-id] is now ONLINE
```

### **User Online Event:**
```
[SOCKET] 🟢 User came online: {userId: '[user-id]', username: '[username]', ...}
[SOCKET] 🔍 Current user ID: [current-user-id]
[CHAT_PAGE] 🟢 User came online: {userId: '[user-id]', ...}
[CHAT_PAGE] ✅ Updated online users after adding: ['[user-id]']
```

### **User Offline Event:**
```
[SOCKET] 🔴 User went offline: {userId: '[user-id]', username: '[username]', ...}
[SOCKET] 🔍 Current user ID: [current-user-id]
[CHAT_PAGE] 🔴 User went offline: {userId: '[user-id]', ...}
[CHAT_PAGE] ✅ Updated online users after removing: ['[user-id]']
```

### **Tab Close/Logout:**
```
[APP] 🚪 Tab closing or page unloading - disconnecting socket
[AUTH] 📡 Offline status sent to server
[SOCKET] 🔌 Manually disconnecting...
[SOCKET] ✅ Disconnected successfully
```

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **Issue: User ID shows as "unknown"**
- **Cause**: Token not properly stored or decoded
- **Fix**: Check if `authToken` is being set in socket service
- **Debug**: Add `console.log('Auth token:', this.authToken)` in `getCurrentUserId()`

### **Issue: Online/offline events not received**
- **Cause**: Socket listeners not properly set up
- **Fix**: Check if `enhancedSocketService.on()` is being called
- **Debug**: Verify socket connection status

### **Issue: Multiple connections for same user**
- **Cause**: Old socket not being disconnected
- **Fix**: Check backend logs for "Disconnecting old socket" message
- **Debug**: Verify `connectedUsers` map in backend

### **Issue: Status not updating in UI**
- **Cause**: React state not updating properly
- **Fix**: Check if `setOnlineUsers` is being called
- **Debug**: Add console logs in `handleUserOnline`/`handleUserOffline`

## 📊 **Backend Logs to Monitor**

```bash
# User connection
[CONNECTION] 🔗 User [user-id] connected with socket [socket-id]
[ONLINE_STATUS] ✅ User [user-id] is now ONLINE

# User disconnection
[CONNECTION] 🔌 User [user-id] disconnected: [reason]
[ONLINE_STATUS] ❌ User [user-id] is now OFFLINE
[CONNECTION] ✅ User [user-id] offline status broadcasted to all users

# Multiple tab handling
[CONNECTION] 🔄 User [user-id] already connected, disconnecting old socket [old-socket-id]
[CONNECTION] 🔗 User [user-id] connected with socket [new-socket-id]
```

## ✅ **Success Criteria**

1. **✅ User ID properly decoded from token**
2. **✅ Online status shows correctly in chat list**
3. **✅ Tab close triggers offline status**
4. **✅ Logout triggers offline status**
5. **✅ Multiple tabs handled correctly**
6. **✅ Real-time status updates work**
7. **✅ No duplicate socket connections**
8. **✅ Proper cleanup on disconnect**

## 🔄 **Next Steps**

If issues persist:
1. Check browser network tab for WebSocket connections
2. Verify backend Socket.IO server is running
3. Check for any CORS issues
4. Verify JWT token is valid and not expired
5. Check for any JavaScript errors in console

---

**Note**: This fix addresses the core issues with online/offline status detection and socket management. The system should now properly handle multiple browser tabs, tab close events, and logout functionality.
